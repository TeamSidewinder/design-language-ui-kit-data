# Live Nation Design Language UI Kit Data
A collection of placeholder data for use as [Sketch custom data](https://medium.com/sketch-app-sources/using-the-new-data-feature-in-sketch-52-daee8403cabb). Use this info to populate designs created from the Live Nation Design Language UI Kit.

## Requirements
 
### Live Nation Design Language UI Kit
Download the [LNDL UI Kit](https://github.com/TeamSidewinder/design-language-ui-kit/archive/master.zip.)

### Sketch
Download the most recent version of [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com).


## Getting Started
Download and unzip the `LNDL Data` folder into your Documents directory so the file path is `HD/Users/[YourName]/Documents/LNDL Data`. This exact path is important to use or you will lose the data in your Sketch designs in future updates. 

In Sketch, open `Sketch > Preferences` then click the `Data` tab. Click the `Add Data` button and select all the data files in your `LNDL Data` folder.

In any text element or text symbol override, you can now populate your designs with the different Live Nation data types.

In Sketch 52, Sketch released a new feature that allows designers to link text and image files to be used as fake data. Read more about this feature and [how to install data sets here](https://medium.com/sketch-app-sources/using-the-new-data-feature-in-sketch-52-daee8403cabb).
